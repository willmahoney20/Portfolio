            <p>My coding journey began in 2020. Like most new programmers, it started out on <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/' alt='freeCodeCamp site' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp</a>, where I learnt the basics of programming in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Eventually, after a few months of completing online courses and following YouTube tutorials, I had enough knowledge to start building my first major coding project, <a href='https://www.matchbetr.com' alt='matchBetr site' target='_blank'>matchBetr.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, most of my time is spent working on coding projects, but I also enjoy spending time playing football, reading, going to the gym, watching movies and hanging out with my family and friends.</p>
